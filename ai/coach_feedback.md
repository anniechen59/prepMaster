## Overall Performance
- **Grade**: C
- The rehearsal showed a clear grasp of content on most slides but was marred by pacing issues and high mumble rates.

## Slide-by-Slide Feedback
- **Slide 0**: Content coverage was weak (25.0%). You missed several key terms that are essential to understanding this slide.
- **Slide 2**: Mumble Rate was high (32.1%). Focus on articulation to ensure clarity.
- **Slide 3**: Mumble Rate was high (31.9%). This impacted the clarity of your delivery.
- **Slide 4**: Content coverage was very weak (12.5%), and the pacing was too slow (59.9 WPM). This slide needs significant improvement.

## 3 Actionable Tips for Next Time
1. **Articulation Practice**: Since your mumble rate was consistently high, practice enunciating clearly. Open your mouth wider and articulate each word to improve clarity.
2. **Content Review**: Revise slides 0 and 4 thoroughly to ensure you cover all necessary keywords and concepts. This will enhance your understanding and delivery.
3. **Pacing Adjustment**: On slide 4, aim to increase your speed to at least 90 WPM. Practice reading aloud at a faster pace to get comfortable with the right speed. 

Keep pushing forward, and focus on these areas for a more polished presentation!
